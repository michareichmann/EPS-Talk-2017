\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
	\begin{itemize}
		\itemfill
% 		\item closely working with manufacturers \ra increase diamond quality
		\item impact of diamonds in LHC is increasing
% 		\item ATLAS \& CMS BCM/BLM see collisions again
% 		\begin{itemize}
% 			\item abort, luminosity and background functionality in all LHC experiments
% 		\end{itemize}
		\item one of the first pixel projects started taking data:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item ATLAS DBM re-commissioned for \SI{13}{\tera\electronvolt} collisions
		\end{itemize}
		\item quantification and understanding of the rate effects in diamond
		\begin{itemize}
			\item pCVD shows no rate effect up to \SI{10}{\mega\hertz\per cm^2} 
			\item shown for fluence up to \SI{5e14}{n\per cm^2}
		\end{itemize}
		\item great progress in 3D detector prototypes
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 3D works in pCVD diamond; scale up and smaller cells also worked
		\end{itemize}
		\item production and successful test of 3D diamond pixel devices
		\begin{itemize}
			\item efficiency looks good; pulse height in progress
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
